"5","2019-07-02 15:41:01","TOMATO REPORT: Vernissage is pretty but mealy and doesn’t like our various pests much. Creole is producing big tomatoes but the plants don’t seem all that happy and I’m having to pull some of them green and ripen on the counter. Blue Berries is trucking along like a boss."
"6","2019-07-02 15:40:43","Crazy thing I did this week: promoted my work w/o apologizing for it. It made me a little squirmy, then less so, then a little stronger, happier and fuller after that. I recommend it highly &amp; will support you to do the same. Be seen. Get loved. Give to others. Share happy things."

"9","2019-07-02 15:40:27","@McNuge4lyfe @snowflake33470 @johniadarola @BernieSanders I am still thinking that Bernie's got this. He has consistently polled higher than Harris and Warren and is generally more well known than anyone except Biden. I would be pretty happy with Warren and I would be marginally happy with Harris."

"15","2019-07-02 15:40:03","@SwaggXBL Im kind of on the fence for the nuke at the moment.   Like. A mw2 style nuke again would be awesome!! But on the other hand a mw3 style Moab would be nice as well so doubles and triples can be a challenge once again    I’ll be happy with either honestly but I couldn’t pick one🤔"
"16","2019-07-02 15:40:01","Happy 2nd of July?!  It's not the right day to celebrate independence day but congress had voted to declare independence two days earlier, on July 2, but it was not declared until July 4. 4th of July sounds better anyway!! How are you celebrating?"

Since things don't translate well, and other things, people should be happy someone's even trying"
